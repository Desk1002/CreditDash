This web application, developed for Afriland First Bank, enables the prediction of loan default risks using banking data through an intuitive Streamlit-based interface. It offers interactive data visualization via dashboards, training and evaluation of machine learning models such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and neural networks, as well as prediction segmentation by credit type and client profile. An explanatory approach from game theory, utilizing Shapley values, is integrated to make model decisions transparent by illustrating the impact of each variable on the predictions.
